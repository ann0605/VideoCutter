//2.	The sales is a two dimensional array that has a row for each item in inventory.  
//The first column of the row is the item number, 
//the remaining numbers are quantities sold to different customers. 
//For example, the first row provides information on item number 2323, 
//and says one customer was sold 50 of item 2323, another was sold 40 of the item and another was sold 54. 
//So for item 2323, 3   customers were sold a total of 144 of item 2323. 
//Assume your program already has the following:
//    int[][] sales = { {2323,50,40,54 },
//                            {3333,40,60,60,40 39},
//                            {3421,50,60, 88,89}, 
//                            …                                    // many more lines of data go here 
//                            {80,99 }   };
//Write code to be inserted into the Main method  to output,  via System.out.printlin,  the following three values:
//•	Number of sales where the quantity sold was over 80.
//•	The item number with the highest quantity sold in total (sum of all quantities for that item)
//•	The item number with the most customers.
